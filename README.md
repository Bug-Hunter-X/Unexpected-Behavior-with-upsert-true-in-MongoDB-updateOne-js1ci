# MongoDB updateOne with upsert: true Unexpected Behavior

This example demonstrates a potential issue when using the `upsert: true` option with the `updateOne` method in MongoDB. If the update operation fails due to validation rules or other constraints, the upsert operation might not behave as expected, potentially leading to data inconsistencies or errors.  This is less common but can be critical to avoid.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet uses `updateOne` with `upsert: true` to increment the age of a user. If the user exists, the age is incremented. If not, a new user is created. However, if there's a validation rule preventing the update (e.g., a maximum age limit), the upsert operation may fail silently or create an incomplete document instead of simply inserting the new document as expected.
